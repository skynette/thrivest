Businesses that meet our strong process criteria are selected for due diligence, including detailed analysis of their operations, financial performance, governance structures, operational efficiency, market positioning, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risks. We evaluate commercial viability, scalability, and the ability to deliver long-term, measurable value to both shareholders and stakeholders.
